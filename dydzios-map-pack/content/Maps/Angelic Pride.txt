		This map is set at Impossible, but it IS Possible.

		There are enough resources around to build a good, strong Castle.

	Episode IV: The Gathering

		Main Enemy: Red (Goes approx. from Month 1 to 3)

		King Graven is good on Ballistics early on, use it to kill the Pikemen and
		Archers that guard the Wood and Ore Mines

		Build a Fort/Town Hall in the main Castle by the end of week 1.

		Ivor can capture the Gold Mine on the Cape.

		Have Ivor capture the Rampart on the Cape guarded by 2 Nagas and 
		one of each other Tower creature.
			
		Protect Ivor's Elves. Sacrifice as few as possible.
			
		Get the spells from the shrines and the dwarves from the two 
		Dwarf Dwellings.
			
		Do Not worry about the Giants that protect the obelisk until later.

		Have Caitlin prepare to defeat the 12 Minitaur Kings that protect 
		the Black Tent.
			
		Use Visions wisely. Some will join Caitlin, some will not.
			
		Protect the Ogre mage!!!! Bloodlust is crucial for the Champion.
			
		Check the hole in one of the prison cells.
			
		Cure the Champion when needed.
		The ogres in the guard training room will join Caitlin, rescue them!

		The ONLY way off the Cape is by retrieving the Seer Artifact found in the Waste Lands.

		During the first month, Graven can acquire all his Castle Dwellings and Mines.

		Red Necromancers will start to show up by the End of the First Month.

		By the beginning of the second month, Caitlin and Ivor can join forces and enter the
		Wastelands.

		The Seer Artifact is guarded by Gold Dragons and Ancient Behomoths, teamwork is necessary.

		Caitlin AND Ivor must BOTH survive in order to get off the Cape.

		Only Caitlin can "see" the island below the lighthouse. (She needs both vision artifacts)
		Only Ivor can get the spell "Water Walk" from the Seer by giving her the Seer Artifact.

		By the end of month 2, The Necromancers will have found their own White Tent and come
		pouring in. 

		Ivor and Caitlin must hurry and help Graven defeat the Red Necromancers.

		It is possible for Ivor and Caitlin to arrive and help Graven by the beginning
		of month 3.

		After Red is Dead, Ivor can "Water Walk" to the small island and read the Brown Tent.
		Caitlin (when all is ready) can re enter the underground and read the Purple Tent.
		Her Seer will help her escape.
			

	Episode V:  The Relics
		
		Main Enemy: Blue (Months 3 to 4)

		The Cyclops King MUST read the purple Tent do NOT Kill him now.

		The Blue Computer AI will generally "Load up" two Heroes with alot of creatures.
		Avoid them, for now. Just Find the Relics.]

		Get that Grail!!

		Use the sanctuary if Home base is attacked.

		You do NOT need to kill Blue to win the Game. But you can if you want.

		Once all 5 relics are found, (sometime in month 5), send the SUPERHERO into the 
		under ground. 

	Episode VI:  Unlikely Allies
		
		Main Enemy: Purple (Months 4 to 6)

		Save the Angel, get the Green Tent and then head up the Mountain Path in the North.

		in order to cast spells on his Black Dragons and Titans.

		By the time you reach him, (Month 6), he will have 100 Black Dragons and about 300 Titans.
		Kill him using Blind, Curse, Slow etc. He has a Cape that does NOT allow 3rd Level spells
		or higher!!!!

		You need this Cape to get the spell "Fly" from the Seer there.

		Fly to Heaven! Follow the signs!

		There are 1000 Titans protecting the Angel dwelling. Kill them. remember that you have 
		Archangles that can resurrect and ALL your spells!

		Before getting that 1 Angel, try and kill all of Purple and Blue!
