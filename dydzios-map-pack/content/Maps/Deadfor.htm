<p><font color="#800040" size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong><u>Pretext:</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#800040" size="2" face="Arial">The scenery of
this adventure mainly consists of deciduous forest with elements
of coniferous forest, open moors, meadows and at certain
locations swamps. The traversability is generally easy. The
forest wildlife includes hare, roe deer, deer, fox, wild boar,
birds, squirrel, wolf, and so forth.</font></p>

<p><font color="#800040" size="2" face="Arial">The only area that
is non traversable is the area surrounded by Mountain Stream -
Mountain Isle. This area is covered with tall trees, reaching to
the skies and is named Dead Forest, because these trees do not
grow any more.<br>
Indeed, they are not dead, but they aren't alive either. Always
shrouded in green, they stand as a legacy of forlorn days.<br>
A time that is long lost, ever since the Elves left. Maybe the
trees are mourning their old friends, with whom they lived in
harmony and in peace.</font></p>

<p><font color="#800040" size="2" face="Arial">Those who are
familiar with Mountain Isle also know about Dead Forest.<br>
The few Elves still travelling here often bewail the new era that
has erased the old one.<br>
Others sometimes regard the trees as eternal symbols depicting
what 'old' is and was, and also how lasting nature is.<br>
</font></p>

<p><a name="Chapter 1"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong><u>Chapter
1</u></strong></font></a><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong><u>:</u></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the new age dawned, Elves,
Dwarves, Halflings and Giants saw the Humans taking their first
unsteady steps onto the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Together they witnessed how the
world changed as men migrated.<br>
In their lust for power, the Humans trampled down, broke apart,
devastated and laid in ruins.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Old Peoples gathered one last
time, holding a council as to what could be done about these
atrocities. The final decision was made and it concluded that the
Old Peoples would be better off uprooting and returning back home
to their forlorn realms.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A mere few were more hopeful and
decided to stay and create a home in this new Civilization, as
the Humans called it.<br>
The King of the Dwarves received the most precious of gifts from
Elves, Halflings and Giants, and he in turn, gave the gifts as a
parting gift to those who had decided to stay behind in the depth
of the Mountain that formed an uncrossable border between the new
world and the old one.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A tremendous gate forming the
entrance to these new halls in the Mountain was built and
furnished with three Keys - each one given to the homegoing
people of the Elves, Halflings and Giants.<br>
However, as with most great works, the gate had not yet been
finished before the Humans came, trampling down on the nearby
grounds.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Old Peoples had already headed
towards their forlorn homes and only those who had stayed in
order to wait for the keys to be finished were left.<br>
These Keybearers however, fell victims to evil-hearted Human
leaders who feared and envied the firstborn peoples.<br>
The Keys which could have reunited the Old Peoples were now in
the hands of different men (and later, beasts).<br>
The Dwarves of the Mountain were now left at the mercy of men,
but they discovered this while there was still time left!<br>
They immediately started building new secret tunnels and new
underground realms...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now the first halls stand empty
and abandoned, sealed with the lock that may only be unlocked by
the three Keys...<br>
As time passed, the tale of the gate faded away and the Keys went
missing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today, a mere few know about the
existence of the gate and fewer yet know about the Keys.<br>
But fewest are those who know about the Poem that tells of the
usage of the Keys...</font><br>

<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">Following a slow descent, using the
rope-ladder, you finally find yourselves in a quadratic cave in
the earth.<br>
The air is musty and it feels cold and damp down here. It is very
dark and you are forced to light a torch.<br>
Looking around you, you see three galleries leading south, east
and west.<br>
The walls seem to be made out of trampled, hard packed soil.<br>
You also notice that the hole is inhabited by various spiders,
worms, insects, larvae and other 'bugs'.</font></p>

'The Galleries' entry now]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>T</strong>he <strong>G</strong>alleries

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A narrow gallery (4x1x2m) is
leading straight east and west, ending with an iron-mounted,
closed oaken door.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The two galleries leading north
also end up with similar doors.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To the south, a niche is leading
to a broken oaken door (also iron-mounted).<br>
A rusty crowbar is lying on the threshold to the room behind that
door.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We told you the map would
lead us to untold treasures&quot;, Ivil says, his eyes shining
with expectation and pride.<br>
Tuvinel almost sniffs at him.<br>
She definately seems to think that raiding tombs is neither
rewarding nor wise.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The oaken door is locked but
Filundrus claims that he is a master of picking locks.<br>
&quot;Give me a moment and I'll have the door opened&quot;, he
whispers and starts working with the lock.<br>
Meanwhile you all stand in silence, watching the man do his work.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial">[If you have

remember the dangerous encounter with the spirit of the deceased
corpse of the last room. Who knows what can be found in this
room. You look around you and see that the other members of the
party also seem tense and worried...</font></p>

You</font></a><font color="#800040" size="2" face="Arial"> wonder
whether it is right to disturb the peace in this ancient tomb.<br>
Obviously somebody has been here before and they don't seem to
have made it back again!<br>
You recall ancient mythological stories, claiming that all graves
are holy and disturbing them would invoke the wrath of the
spirits...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally the lock clicks and a
triumphant Filundrus exclaims: &quot;After you, madame!&quot;.<br>
You enter through the door into a rectangular room (6x3x3m).<br>
The first thing that catches your eyes is a podium made of stone,
carrying an ornated sarcophagus. At the opposite wall in a niche,
a Shield faintly glimmering in the flickering light of your
torches, is mounted. The Shield is obviously made of gold, but
you can't reach it (- some sort of invisible barrier blocks the
niche).<br>
While admiring the shield, Ivil and Filundrus move towards the
Sarcophagus.<br>
&quot;Help us get this thing open&quot;, they whisper.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial">[Proceed reading
this entry when prompted by the map]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ornated stone cover of the
Sarcophagus is extremely heavy (~250kg) and you realize that you
have to try to push it out of place, not lift it. Sweat pearls
start rolling down your face, but your efforts are rewarded when
the cover finally seizes to resist and slowly, with a muffled
rumbling, starts shifting away from its place.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the cover finally is off you
stare in amazement at the ancient remains of a long dead Knight,
while catching your breaths. Obviously he must have been a great
warrior. A mostly corroded cuirass covers his upper body and by
his side lies a two-handed Sword in a decayed leather scabbard.<br>
Looking at his skull, you see that he fell victim to a heavy blow
through his scalp.<br>
Around his head, a frontlet of solid gold holds his skull
together.<br>
Strewn around him are coins, bracelets and gems.<br>
Staring at all these details, you hardly notice the chilly wind,
starting to circle around your feet. The wind is icy, almost
caressing and it has a paralysing effect on you.<br>
&quot;Run! Run!&quot; you scream to Ivil and Filundrus, but they
seem frozen in place.<br>
Then, powerful as a thunderbolt, a dark voice cries &quot;How
dare you disturb my rest! You are fools, yes you are certainly
fools! So be it, fools - now you shall embrace death!&quot;.<br>
At the same moment you tumble out of the paralysis, only to be
faced with a dark creature, slowly rising from the Sarcophagus..
- ..accompanied by two guardian spirits!</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial">[Proceed after
having resolved the battle]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The spirits have been killed or
banished, at least for now. Ivil and Filundrus are shaking with
horror but they nevertheless start seizing all valuables.<br>
Tuvinel regards them with an icy look as you investigate the
shining Sword.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>T</strong>he <strong>S</strong>on

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You try to open the door but it is
locked.<br>
&quot;I will open the door&quot;, Tuvinel says and looks around
to see if anybody wishes to protest.<br>
Filundrus is about to say something, but is silenced by the fiery
expression in her eyes.<br>
&quot;Good, now keep still. I need to focus on my spell... Delet
ha ktanah, tiftechi...&quot;.<br>
Tuvinel begins a ritual consisting of strange words and
movements. You, having had a little schooling in some magic know
that she is trying to get into a certain mental state that will
allow her to do things people normally aren't capable of. These
states differ with the tasks and a wrong state of mind would
either have no effect or possibly have an unpredictable, usually
dangerous effect.<br>
Eventually, she reaches the proper state of mind and seems to
become a part of the lock. She turns like a key and the lock
clicks!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You enter a small chamber (3x3x2m)
with a small coffin at the western wall.<br>
Obviously it has been made for a boy. This is coherent with
ancient traditions, though. It was customary that children
followed their father to the grave.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial">[Proceed reading
this entry when prompted by the map]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The coffin is locked but Ivil
breaks it open with some blows by his axe.<br>
&quot;What on earth are you doing, you idiot&quot;, Tuvinel
snarls. &quot;You could have us all killed. Don't you know that
defiling the graves of the dead will attract their
attention?&quot;.<br>
&quot;What kind of threat could a long dead child pose?&quot;
Ivil counters and starts investigating the coffin.<br>
Inside lie the remains of a young boy. His silken clothes have
worn unbelievably well.<br>
A short-sword rests beside him...<br>
Almost as an answer to Tuvinel's warning, a cold wind surges
through the room and a far from friendly spirit materializes in
front of you...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You enter a smallish room (3x3x2m)
with a broken chest at the southern wall. At both sides of the
chest, the remains of two long dead 'adventurers' lie, dressed in
chain-mails. Swords, axes, torches, ropes, nails, a blanket and a
small sack are strewn about the floor.<br>
(Everything is unusable due to the effects of the humid air).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Inside the chest lies a grand
warrior, carrying a corroded chain-mail.<br>
On his chest rests a great black pole axe. At his waist there is
a money pouch. Apart from these things, the room is empty.<br>
&quot;Don't touch anything&quot;, Tuvinel urges with a
threatening voice.<br>
Ivil and Filundrus look dissapointed and seem to hope that you'll
let them.</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial">[Proceed reading
this entry when prompted by the map]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Neglecting the warnings of
Tuvinel, you touch the remains of the warrior, while
investigating the contents of the chest.<br>
Immediately a cold wind surges through the room and a revengeful
spirit materializes.<br>
It is not alone, though. The two corpses of the former
adventurers also rise!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The door is not locked, so you
just open it and enter. The room is small (3x3x2m) and an open,
rottening coffin lies along the eastern wall.<br>
Inside the coffin rests the remains of a woman, dressed in
rottening clothes.<br>
She also wears a frontlet of silver, three golden rings, a golden
bracelet, two golden earrings with green jewels and a pearl
necklace.<br>
It was common that the wife also joined her husband when he died
- especially if her husband was a great Knight.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;That necklace seems to be
enchanted&quot;, Tuvinel exclaims, leaning forward over the
coffin, an excited look playing on her face.<br>
But as she touches the necklace, the corpse shivers and a
horrible moaning resonates throughout the room. You flinch back
from the coffin as some undead spirit gains control over the
remains of the woman...</font></p>

<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">You have arrived at a calm and
peaceful house, next to Little Lake, in the southwesternpart of
the forest.<br>
Here, Mountain Stream falls into Little Lake. Little Lake is
quiet and glassy.<br>
Green tree-tops are reflected in the sky-blue water.<br>
At Little Lake's western beach stands a small wooden house
(5x4x3m).<br>
Smoke is gently coming out of the chimney. A kitchen door (and
also the front door) faces the south and is flanked by two
windows with open shutters. All kinds of herbs, crops and plants
grow around the house.<br>
You can literally feel the quiet calmness surrounding the place.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">A young enchantress lives here,
secluded and undisturbed by unwanted people.<br>
You walk up to the door and a tall, dark woman in her mid
twenties opens it and welcomes you as her guests after having
spoken (briefly) with Ketolous.<br>
Her name is Elusia and she has beautiful features and speaks with
a soft voice.<br>
She wears light green clothes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You explain to her who you are and
what you are seeking over a delicious soup that she is serving.<br>
&quot;I know only a little about the tale of the Gate, but when I
was younger, I was an adventuress like you Wren. I know that you
need to have three keys in order to open the Gate. During one of
my journeys I came across one of them, the White Pearl&quot;.<br>
&quot;Can we have it? We must open the Gate and reunite the Old
Peoples before it is too late&quot;, you implore and Elusia nods
thoughtfully:<br>
&quot;Well, I guess you could Wren, but I too have a problem.
Maybe we could help each other?&quot;<br>
You agree and she tells you that she needs a special Crystal,
which can only be found in the Temple of the Winds.<br>
If you can bring her this Crystal then she will give you the
White Pearl.<br>
<br>
Elusia is a good healer and she teaches you how to heal people.<br>

<br>
</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Ketolous is
the only centaur of the forest. He therefore often feels very
lonely.<br>
Usually he trots along in different parts of the forest, hunting
game to offer to Elusia.<br>
Each day at dawn he brings her something in exchange for moments
of conversation.<br>
He is a friendly creature who is familiar with the local
surroundings.<br>
He can provide you with the following information:<br>
<br>
&quot;A couple of Minotaurs are roaming the area of Dark Woods.
They attack anyone who is weaker than they are.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The disgusting orcs have a hideout to the north-east. They
are numerous, but stupid.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I once saw a magician in the northern parts of the forest.
He seemed to be looking for something. I didn't sense any
hostility from him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have seen the most fearful black knight, riding a black
horse. I think he is a servant of Sathmog.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Deep Swamp lies in the south-eastern parts. I have seen a
strange eremite living there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Deep inside the forest, I think there is a Barrow Mound,
however I am not sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The forest is haunted by many rogues and Green-skins. At
night three hideous Trolls roam the areas in search of
unsuspecting prey.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dead forest is a place haunted by long dead elves and the
Temple of the Winds is a place belonging to Raisers of
Spirits.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Beyond Deep Swamp there is an entrance to the
Shadow-worlds.&quot;<br>
<br>
You know that some of the things Ketolous believes can't be true.
The Temple of the Winds for instance can't be a hideout for
Raisers of Spirits. However, he seems to be well aquainted with
this region, so it couldn't hurt to pay attention to his advice.<br>

<br>
<font size="2" face="Arial">After a long journey you have finally
reached the fabled Temple of the Winds.<br>
Seemingly on the top of Mountain Island, where the Archaean rock
has been smoothened by the winds of millenia, a strange structure
rests.<br>
<br>
It looks like a huge podium (16x10x1m), is made of white stone
and it rises through three stages in order to bevel the highest
peak of the mountain.<br>
<br>
From the podium, high pillars (4m) are towering. Stairs are
leading from the southern part of the temple up to two almost
invisible doors of crystal (each door measuring 3x1½m,1dm
thick).<br>
<br>
Behind the two pillars flanking the double door, there are two
columns of 4 pillars each, forming walls of pillars.<br>
You can't see any ordinary walls or a roof.<br>
The winds are fresh and cool around this place and you pause a
moment to rest and to 'feel' the place.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my, what a tranquil and beautiful place&quot;, Tuvinel
says.<br>
&quot;Yes, indeed&quot;, Giljath replies. &quot;It was built a
long time ago&quot;<br>
<br>
(- Coming from an elf, this means v e r y, very long ago).<br>
&quot;We elves were numerous in those days. This shrine was meant
to be a place for resting your spirit, but later it became the
home of the Windmistress.<br>
She found the place so breathtaking that she stayed and helped us
with solving problems of the mind and so&quot;.<br>
<br>
Eldur continues: &quot;However, when the humans arrived, we had
to enchant the place in order to guard it from them. They were
not enlightened and having such a short life span(?), they were
too eager, too aggresive and generally too emotionally
unbalanced.&quot;<br>
Tuvinel, being human, gets an upset look in her eyes, but calms
down. Ivil and Filundrus are too absorbed by the place and the
story to get the underlying implication and Eldur finishes:<br>
&quot;...The humans immediately wanted to know all the secrets of
Life and the Universe and their minds couldn't be calmed. So now
one needs to know how to invoke the Windmistress and the place is
protected from human intrusion by spirits of the air&quot;, Eldur
finishes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">You (Wren) are also familiar with
the place. While Giljath and Eldur have been explaining the
history of the Temple, you have walked up to the double doors,
found the almost invisible inscriptions (in Elvish) and recited
them silently.<br>
<br>
As Eldur and Giljath have finished, so have you and the doors
quietly open up. &quot;I must enter alone&quot;, you tell the
others and Giljath and Eldur nod understandingly.<br>
However, you have spoken in Elvish and the excited Ivil and
Filundrus do not understand this beautiful language. Their
eagerness to behold the Windmistress results in the triggering of
the protective enchantment and guardian air spirits attack!</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Arial">[Proceed after
having resolved the battle]</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After finally having calmed the
air spirits down, you make sure that no humans enter the Temple
and then you invoke the Windmistress.<br>
In a moment she comes, invisible but you are in trance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Many Bad Things I hear, but I don't shed a tear. Tell me
what you seek, I will give you - If you speak&quot;.<br>
(You understand that you'll have to talk in rhyme, if the
Windmistress is going to understand you).<br>
<br>
&quot;My lady, be thou greeted, I am here to be nicely

In the center of the pentagram, Windhand the Sorcerer stands,
chanting in an unfamiliar human (?) language.<br>

He appears to be a short, slim creature - rather peculiar looking
- with an odd smile and small peering eyes.<br>
He chants with a bright voice and gesticulates strangely. He
seems both old and young.<br>
He is dressed in a carmosine red cowl. Over is shoulder hangs a
small satchel and over his right shoulder hangs the third Key -
the Horn of Shell.<br>
He wears sandals and a large, green pointy hat.<br>

Windhand seems almost sad as he replies: &quot;I am sorry, Wren.

five pathetic gremlins snored loudly and you realized that if it
would come to battle, then you'd have to spend a lot of energy in
order to keep them alive. They were actually more in the way than
helpful.<br>
You were pondering how to gently break the news that they'd be
safer off moving along without you. The mission was already hard
enough as it was...<br>
Then Ivil wakes up, saying &quot;Hooves!&quot;.<br>
&quot;Cut it out. There haven't been any horses around this
neighbourhood for years!&quot; Tuvinel exlcaims contemptuously.
&quot;You are only dreaming&quot;.<br>
&quot;I'm sure. I heard hooves&quot;, Ivil says, sighs and sits
up next to you at the campfire.<br>
You are about to ask him more about the hooves he heard, when all
of a sudden, loud bellows echoe through the night.<br>
<br>
&quot;We get glory!!&quot;, sounds through the air, as two huge
shapes with large two-handed axes dash forward towards your

scramble to their feet, trying to defend against the two

This Dark Knight has stolen a relic from their temple in the far

try to recover the relic (- pendant of life) and to see to it

Mountain down to the forests, deep watery and sludgy swamplands
stretch around. The depths of this huge swamp are unknown, hence
it got the name Deep Swamps.<br>
It is a jumble of marshes with treacherous bogs, slithering
roots, murky plants and a neverending buzz of countless of
insects living in the swamp.<br>
<br>
Through the swamp lands, Swamp Path leads. It seems to be the
only way leading to the Mountain. No people is living in the
swamp and almost nobody ever visits it.<br>
Those who stray from Swamp Path risk being sucked down into the
unknown depths.<br>
You are constantly trying to calm down Ivil and Filundrus who
complain about the environment and want to go home.<br>
<br>
So, after a hard journey, you arrive at a small lake with a raft
in the center.<br>
On this raft, a small tent has been erected. The tent is
overgrown with winding plants, moss, roots and leaves.<br>
Some smoke is coming out of the top of the tent.<br>
You decide to enter the tent alone.<br>
<br>
The only way to reach it is by walking on some slippery stepping
stones, barely visible at the surface of the small lake.<br>
After a long time of balancing acts you finally reach the tent
and enter.<br>
<br>
You find yourself in front of a small fire with a pot hanging
above it.<br>
Yarns with dried plants and fruits are streched inside the tent.<br>
Along the ground you see receptacles, bowls, flasks and casks
containing unidentified liquids et.c.<br>
At the opposite side of the entrance, an old man, wearing a torn
robe, is filling a pipe.<br>
You can't see his face but his hands definately seem old.<br>

A moment of silence follows by a cough:<br>
<br>
&quot;You have to open the Gate and find your long gone ancestors
and their allies. In order to achieve this you need three Keys -
The White Pearl, the Black Pearl and the Horn of Shell. Having
them is not enough, though. You also need to know how to use them
properly. In my possesion I have a charm inscribed with these

&quot;Well, I don't know&quot;, Ivil admits. After a considerable
moment of thought he continues:<br>
&quot;We'll just have to cope with the most valuable
things&quot;...<br>

You are surprised that it ends so abruptly, as if it hadn't been
mined out any more.<br>
&quot;I think there might be a hidden door on this wall... let me
check&quot;, Ivil says, putting his hands onto the wall,
searching for something.<br>
After a short moment his hands stop at a loose rock in the wall.
He pulls it out and a lever is revealed. Pulling the lever
results in a stifled rumble and a part of the wall opens up,
revealing an ancient entrance into a strange room.<br>
It is large (15x15x10m) and dark. A strange smell of sulfur meets
your noses.<br>
Ahead, upon a piedestal, lies a beautiful helmet, shining in the
torch light.<br>
Will you approach it?<br>

in to investigate the marvelous helmet, a devastating shriek
sounds through the entire cave. You quickly look around to see a
huge winged reptile, approaching you with the frenzy of a wounded
boar.<br>
The loud noice no doubt must have alerted the whole Cave but you
don't have time to worry about that now. Defend!<br>

long tunnel leading through to an ancient area of Deep Swamp.<br>
Nobody has been here in centuries. Ahead lies the Gate.<br>
As you prepare to go eastwards toward the Gate, a terrible roar
sounds through the lands.<br>
You have awoken a dreadful Hydra! It will try to kill you if you
go any closer!<br>
Well, so be it. If you have to, you will defeat the Hydra - you
must open the Gate!<br>

</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Swamp Path
leads you through the last part of Deep Swamp, and you finally
arrive at a new path, flanked by two absolutely vertical cliffs.<br>
This path leads all the way to a podium of iridescent white
marble stone.<br>
The podium rises through three stages (10x20x1m) and ends up with
the Gate of the Mountain!<br>
The Gate is shaped in a raised pattern and looks like a case of
winding foliage.<br>
The case is flanked by two rearing Unicorns with crossing hornes.<br>
Two gigantic gates are within the case.<br>
Depicted on the gates are four extended hands, meeting at the
center of the gates.<br>
You read the Poem etched on the Charm:<br>
<br>
&quot;On the side of the heart, the light of the moon<br>
Ebony to the eye is sweet<br>
The Seasons sound through the shell<br>
In the Halls of the Dwarves you will dwell&quot;<br>
<br>
Interpreting the Poem, you realize that you must place the White
Pearl in the empty eye of the left unicorn (- while facing
outwards from the gate), the Black Pearl in the empty eye of the
other unicorn and finally you need to sound the Horn of Shell 4
times.<br>
<br>
As you do this, the Gate opens and you may enter!!!<br>
