Designer Notes:

This was a pretty fun map to develop, and again I would like to say this is merely a 
diversionary form of entertainment and is not meant to belittle anybody's religious 
beliefs (or incourage them, heh!) A special effort was made to make the map a 
free-flowing strategy map after an initial period of a scripted story map.   
I hope I got this balanced correctly and the transition is not too abrubt.  I firmly 
believe that too many constraints can ruin a map, especially in the last couple of months
of play. 
Out of necissity, I disabled the Fly and Dimension Door spells.  This hopefully is made
up by the fairly early availability of Town Portal and, of course, the Castle Gates in
the Infernos.

General script:
	Flee for your life!   The angels will hound you down the stairway, kick you out of
the Rampart, pursue you out of the Tower, and trounce you out of the Stronghold.  
Concentrate on getting as many resources as you can, rescue your fellow fallen ones, and
visit the Grail Obelisks.  You should be arriving in Hell around the end of the first month
(maybe a little sooner.)
	You are *not* safe in Hell!  Expand and explore as fast as you can.  You need to 
rescue Lucifer as a priority, and take at least two other inferno towns and get the Grail
installed as soon as possible.  The Devils in the Landing Zone area will join you, so that
will help matters immensely.  The towns after Pandemonium should probably fall to you in 
the following order:  Despair, Famine, Misery, and then Pestilence. You will start seeing
Necro armies cruising your shores by week 7 or 8, with a very tough Thant landing shortly 
afterwards.  
	After you blunt the first couple of Necro incursions, you should be safe enough to 
explore more, take the remaining two Inferno towns, rescue Mephistopheles, and conquer 
Teal.  Next is a maze which is a minor obstical (and a secondary hero experience gainer).
Beware though. The purple Dragon Lords can eventually invade there, so use caution. There
should be some tough battles with purple, and the only valid tactic is really to kill the
black dragons, blind an enemy stack, and Resurrect like crazy to bring your army back.
	Only then may you gain your access back to the surface, only to see some really 
big Angel armies floating around up there.  You really need to use the Armageddon tactic 
with Mephistopheles and Lucifer in order to triumph. Beware!  Blue can eventually get to 
you in Hell starting at around Month 4 to 5, so you are not always going to have a safe 
haven from them.

Tips on fighting with 1 Arch Devil:
	Keep the Spirit of Oppression equipped at all times against opponents that have a 
chance of getting a morale boost.  Take it off for fights with golems and elementals.
Do not forget the value of war machines as diversionary targets! 
The value of a good Cure spell should not be underestimated, as well as Shield.
You have mobility, use it!

Tips for fighting the mega-angel armies at the end:
	You have two fantastic "Armageddon Heroes" for assistants....use them!!!  Hit and run 
tactics will whittle them down quite effectively.  Most are immune to Berserk, so the good	
ole' end-of-days spell is your best hope.  Consider using the Spirit of Oppression again
even on the big fights at the end.  Angels seem to give out *more* than the maximum number
of morale bonuses, but it might just be my imagination. ;o)
