Designer Notes:

This map was a titanic undertaking.  A great deal of research into Norse Mythology and 
historical figures was done.  I have tried to make it as accurate as possible, but 
there will be discrepancies simply because I found so many conflicting interpretations
about this time period.  Most of the Heroes in the game are historically accurate, and
their bios have been adjusted accordingly.

Even though you have 3 human players, this is not a multi-player map.  This merely 
gives you a choice of starting positions, and allows some replayability.  YES! I know
the North Sea is not to scale, and Britain, Ireland, and Denmark are over-large also.
I did this deliberately in order to provide viable kindoms for the opponents.

Guide to the sides:

Red:	English
Blue:	Norwegians
Tan:	Jotuns (Giants)
Green:	Irish	
Orange:	Danes
Purple:	Gods (Vanir and Aesir)
Teal:	Swedes
Pink:	French (Pre-Norman)

The AI turns are really slow at first, as it takes awhile to uncover their realms.  The 
speed will increase as time goes by, but slow hardware my try your patience.

Expand fast.  The second city is designed to fall within the first 8 days or so. 
Take out your fellow Viking strongholds as soon as possible and get them producing
creatures for you, then go exploring.

London holds some key spells.  A raid there may be worth your while.

Your strong opponents are land-locked and can't get to you.

The black tent in Hel is extremely well hidden (Behind the Necro castle.)

The way to Valhalla is by Dimension Door hopscotch (which you pick up in the 
Confluxes) (Or Water walking, with good scouting ability)

The path across the Bifrost Bridge should be the blue one, guarded by Heimdall.
(Blue was the tent in Mimer's Well (The *wise* choice)

Ummm...Good Luck!
